# Data Science Portfolio

This repository is a collection of data science projects showcasing applied skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and model evaluation. Each project contains the problem statement, dataset (or link to it), notebooks, scripts, and results so you can reproduce the work.


## How to run
This repository uses [mkdocs](http://mkdocs.org) to generate a website using github pages.  Github actions are used to deploy the site to github pages.
