# Childcare Costs

This project analyzes U.S. childcare cost data from 2008–2018 to show how childcare—especially infant care—has become more expensive over time and varies widely by state and county. Using clear visualizations and a data storytelling approach, it highlights how rising childcare costs create a growing financial burden for families and frames the issue as a policy problem rather than an individual one.
