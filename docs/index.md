Joshua Ewer's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to a few year's worth of hard work learning how to using machine learning and data science methodologies to solve hard problems!  This portfolio contains ten examples of different exploratory data methods, machine learning models, and various ways to tell a story with data.

- [Projects](projects/list.md) will get you to a detailed list of each project.
- [Concepts](concepts.md) groups each of these projects into common tags
