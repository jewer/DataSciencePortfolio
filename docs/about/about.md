# About Me

I'm a professional and committed software engineer with over 25 years of experience in a wide range of industries, platforms and corporate environments.

As a technology leader, I work with business and management representatives to gather requirements, plan timelines and budgets, and manage teams' technical delivery. I really enjoy working with a development team and helping them to refine and improve their process through the (gradual and team-appropriate) adoption of Agile principals and techniques.

As a software architect, I design and implement systems so I can deliver working products to customers. Despite enjoying the "people" aspects of my job, I never forget that a deep and broad technical skillset is my most important attribute. I love standing in front of a whiteboard and drawing boxes-and-lines, then turning around and coding the night away.

As a data engineer, I dig into complex, large datasets and surface interesting data for further analysis and build products to show the value of the data. Whether it's moving TB of data across cloud providers, building and automating predictive models, or visualizing data in interactive charts or infographs,, it's always exciting to find something new and interesting in data you didn't expect to see.
